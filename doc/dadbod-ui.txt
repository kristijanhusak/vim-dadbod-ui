Define a connection |vim-dadbod-ui-connections|
Execute `:DBUI` command

==============================================================================
3. Commands 					*vim-dadbod-ui-commands*

					      *DBUI*
DBUI
		Open drawer with available connections, or an option to add
		connection if there isn't any. Supports `<mods>`, which means
		that you can open the drawer for example in new tab like this:
		`:tab DBUI`

		`:DBUI`

					      *DBUIToggle*
DBUIToggle
		Toggle the drawer. When closed, same as calling `DBUI`. When
		opened, same as doing `q` in drawer.

		`:DBUIToggle`

					      *DBUIAddConnection*
DBUIAddConnection
		Open a prompt to enter new connection, by providing database
		url and connection name. Once entered, it will be saved in
		connections file located in |g:db_ui_save_location| folder.
		This can also be triggered using key `A` from the drawer. See
		|<Plug>(DBUI_AddConnection)|

		`:DBUIAddConnection`

					      *DBUIFindBuffer*
DBUIFindBuffer
		Find currently opened buffer in DBUI drawer, or if it wasn't
		opened from DBUI, assigns the buffer to specified db.

		`:DBUIFindBuffer`

					      *DBUIRenameBuffer*
DBUIRenameBuffer
		Rename currently opened buffer or saved query. If it's buffer,
		it must be written first.

		`:DBUIRenameBuffer`

					      *DBUILastQueryInfo*
DBUILastQueryInfo
		Print information about last query that was ran.
		It prints the query, and the time it took to finish.

		`:DBUILastQueryInfo`

					      *DBUIHideNotifications*
DBUIHideNotifications
		Hide all floating notifications that are currently shown.
		Does not work with `vim.notify` and `echo` mode

		`:DBUIHideNotifications`

==============================================================================
4. Connections 					*vim-dadbod-ui-connections*

There are multiple ways to set up your database connections:

1. Through environment variables |vim-dadbod-ui-connections-env|
2. Via `g:db` and `g:dbs` global variable |vim-dadbod-ui-connections-g:dbs|
3. Via |DBUIAddConnection| command

It is possible to combine all 3 types, but it's not possible to have same
connection name from same source.

==============================================================================
4.1 Through environment variables		*vim-dadbod-ui-connections-env*

There are 2 ways to define connections using environment variables:

1. Using regular environment variable
This option reads environment variable(s) called `$DBUI_URL` and `$DBUI_NAME`.
`$DBUI_URL` contains connection url
`$DBUI_NAME` contains connection name
if only `$DBUI_URL` is defined,`$DBUI_NAME` is parsed from connection url.
To change name of the variables that are read, change
|g:db_ui_env_variable_url| and |g:db_ui_env_variable_name|.
Note that this option can also leverage `dotenv.vim` since it exports dotenv
variables as regular environment variables.

2. Using https://github.com/tpope/vim-dotenv
This option allows defining multiple connections with multiple env variables
inside your `.env`. For example, this would create two connections:

* `DB_UI_DEV=postgres://postgres:rootpw@localhost:5432/dev-db`
* `DB_UI_PRODUCTION=postgres://postgres:rootpw@localhost:5432/dev-db`

One will be called `dev`, and another one `production`. Connection name is
parsed from the variable name (everything after `DB_UI_` lowercased). To
change the prefix, change `g:db_ui_dotenv_variable_prefix` value.


==============================================================================
4.2 Via `g:db` and `g:dbs` global variable	*vim-dadbod-ui-connections-g:dbs*

This option gives a bit more flexibility, but it's harder to keep it out of
version control.
vim-dadbod `g:db` variable is read first.
`g:dbs` can be defined as an object, or as an array of objects:

Object example:
>
  function s:resolve_production_url()
    return system('get-prod-url')
  end

  let g:dbs = {
  \ 'dev': 'postgres://postgres:mypassword@localhost:5432/my-dev-db',
  \ 'staging': 'postgres://postgres:mypassword@localhost:5432/my-staging-db',
  \ 'wp': 'mysql://root@localhost/wp_awesome',
  \ 'production': function('s:resolve_production_url')
  \ }
<
Array of objects example:
>
  let g:dbs = [
  \ { 'name': 'dev', 'url': 'postgres://postgres:mypassword@localhost:5432/my-dev-db' }
  \ { 'name': 'staging', 'url': 'postgres://postgres:mypassword@localhost:5432/my-staging-db' },
  \ { 'name': 'wp', 'url': 'mysql://root@localhost/wp_awesome' },
  \ { 'name': 'production', 'url': function('s:resolve_production_url') },
  \ ]
<

If you use Neovim, you can also use lua to define the connections:
>
  vim.g.dbs = {
    {
      { name = 'dev', url = 'postgres://postgres:mypassword@localhost:5432/my-dev-db' }
      { name = 'staging', url = 'postgres://postgres:mypassword@localhost:5432/my-staging-db' },
      { name = 'wp', url = 'mysql://root@localhost/wp_awesome' },
      {
        name = 'production',
        url = function()
          return vim.fn.system('get-prod-url')
        end
      },
    }
  }
<


Currently, only difference between these two methods is that array ensures
order, while order of connections with g:dbs as object has arbitrary order.

If you use this method, make sure to `keep it out of version control` .
One way to ensure it's not commited is to use `exrc` option, which allows
creating project level vimrc to hold this configuration. After that, add that
file to your global gitignore file, and you're safe.
Other solution is to have it as a function that resolves a value dynamically.

==============================================================================
4.3 Using `DBUIAddConnection` command	*vim-dadbod-ui-connections-add*

Executing |DBUIAddConnection| opens up a prompt to enter connection that will
be saved in a `connections.json` file in |g:db_ui_save_location| folder. These
connections will be available from everywhere. If you want to delete certain
connection, open up DBUI drawer and press `d` (|<Plug>(DBUI_DeleteLine|) on
the connection you want to delete.

==============================================================================

5. Mappings					*vim-dadbod-ui-mappings*

					      *<Plug>(DBUI_SelectLine)*
<Plug>(DBUI_SelectLine)
		This mapping is used for toggling and opening everything in
		the DBUI drawer.

		By default, mapped to `o`, `Enter` and `Double click` .

					      *<Plug>(DBUI_SelectLineVsplit)*
<Plug>(DBUI_SelectLineVsplit)
		This mapping is used for opening all non-toggle items from
		DBUI drawer in a vertical split.

		By default, mapped to `S`.

					      *<Plug>(DBUI_DeleteLine)*
<Plug>(DBUI_DeleteLine)
		This mapping is used deleting certain items from the DBUI
		drawer. It will work on these:
		1. Buffers
		2. Saved queries
		3. Connections added via |DBUIAddConnection|
		Confirm prompt is opened before deleting to avoid accidents.

		By default, mapped to `d`.

					      *<Plug>(DBUI_JumpToForeignKey)*
<Plug>(DBUI_JumpToForeignKey)
		This mapping is used to jump to foreign key in a table from
		dbout buffer. Currently supported for MySQL, Sqlserver and
		Postgres. Here's an example:

		Having table called "Users":
>
		_____________________________
		| id   | username | password |
		-------+----------+----------
		| 1    | test     | test1    |
		| 2    | john     | johntest |
		------------------------------
<
		And table "Posts" with a defined foreign key to table "Users":
>
		_____________________________
		| id   | userId   | subject  |
		-------+----------+----------
		| 1    | 1        | hello    |
		| 2    | 2        | world    |
		------------------------------
<
		After doing a query to fetch "Posts", and in `.dbout` preview
		window going to the cell with user id of 1 (Note the cursor
		in middle of cell where userId is 1)
>
		___________________________________
		| id   | userId         | subject  |
		-------+----------------+----------
		| 1    | 1  |<- cursor  | hello    |
		| 2    | 2              | world    |
		------------------------------------
<
		And then executing this mapping (by default `<C-]>`), it will
		do a query behind the scenes to fetch the user from table
		"Users" with that id. After executing the mapping, you should
		get this result
>
		_____________________________
		| id   | username | password |
		-------+----------+----------
		| 1    | test     | test1    |
		------------------------------
<
		pressing `r` (dadbods mapping for populating cmd line with
		last query), will give you this:

		`:DB select * from Users where id = 1`

					      *vim-dadbod-ic*
ic
		Operator pending mapping that works on cell value in results
		buffer.  For example, to yank cell value under cursor, do `yic`.
		To visually select it, do `vic`. Also supports custom
		registers.

		Mapped to `ic`.

					      *<Plug>(DBUI_AddConnection)*
<Plug>(DBUI_AddConnection)
		This mapping is used adding a new connection. It is same as
		executing |DBUIAddConnection| command.

		By default, mapped to `A`.

					      *<Plug>(DBUI_ToggleDetails)*
<Plug>(DBUI_ToggleDetails)
		This mapping is used for toggling small note beside all
		connections to see where this connection is defined.
		For example, if you have connection called `dev` in `g:dbs`
		variable, and connection called `production` in your
		connections file, you will see something like this:
>
		    > dev (g:dbs)
		    > production (file)
<
		By default, mapped to `H`.

					      *<Plug>(DBUI_Redraw)*
<Plug>(DBUI_Redraw)
		This mapping is used for redrawing the DBUI drawer. It will
		refresh the tables on all connections that were opened. This
		is usually not needed, only when tables are
		added/edited/deleted via query.

		By default, mapped to `R`.

					      *<Plug>(DBUI_RenameLine)*
<Plug>(DBUI_RenameLine)
		Rename buffer or saved query under cursor, or edit a
		connection added via |DBUIAddConnection|. If it's a buffer,
		it must be written (executed) at least once. Alternative is to
		use |DBUIRenameBuffer| from the buffer.

		By default, mapped to `r`.

					      *<Plug>(DBUI_SaveQuery)*
<Plug>(DBUI_SaveQuery)
		This mapping is used in `sql` files to save the query in
		`g:db_ui_save_location` for later use, since all queries are
		written to temp folder by default. Once saved, it will be
		available in the connection tree under `Saved queries` .

		By default, mapped to `<Leader>W`.

					      *<Plug>(DBUI_ExecuteQuery)*
<Plug>(DBUI_ExecuteQuery)
		Execute query in sql buffer. Supports normal and visual mode.
		Normal mode executes all content in a file, where visual mode
		executes only the selected content.

		By default, mapped to `<Leader>S`.

					      *<Plug>(DBUI_ToggleResultLayout)*
<Plug>(DBUI_ToggleResultLayout)
		Toggle expanded view in the results buffer (column and value
		per line). Currently supported only for MySQL and PostgreSQL.

		By default, mapped to `<Leader>R`.

					      *<Plug>(DBUI_EditBindParameters)*
<Plug>(DBUI_EditBindParameters)
		This mapping is used in `sql` files to edit bind parameters if
		there are any. See |vim-dadbod-ui-bind-parameters|.

		By default, mapped to `<Leader>E`.

					      *?*
?
		This mapping is used to show help in the DBUI drawer, that
		contains mappings that are available. To hide
		`Press ? for help`, see |g:db_ui_show_help|

					      *<Plug>(DBUI_Quit)*
<Plug>(DBUI_Quit)
		Mapping for closing the drawer.

		By default, mapped to `q`.

					      *<Plug>(DBUI_GotoFirstSibling)*
<Plug>(DBUI_GotoFirstSibling)
		Go to first sibling in current context.

		By default, mapped to `<C-k>`.

					      *<Plug>(DBUI_GotoLastSibling)*
<Plug>(DBUI_GotoLastSibling)
		Go to last sibling in current context.

		By default, mapped to `<C-j>`.

					      *<Plug>(DBUI_GotoPrevSibling)*
<Plug>(DBUI_GotoPrevSibling)
		Go to previous sibling in current context.

		By default, mapped to `K`.

					      *<Plug>(DBUI_GotoNextSibling)*
<Plug>(DBUI_GotoNextSibling)
		Go to previous sibling in current context.

		By default, mapped to `J`.

					      *<Plug>(DBUI_GotoParentNode)*
<Plug>(DBUI_GotoParentNode)
		Go to parent node from current context.

		By default, mapped to `<C-p>`.

					      *<Plug>(DBUI_GotoChildNode)*
<Plug>(DBUI_GotoChildNode)
		Go to child node from current context. It works only on
		entries that can be toggled (dbs, schemas, tables, ...)

		By default, mapped to `<C-n>`.

==============================================================================
6. Table helpers				*vim-dadbod-ui-table-helpers*

Table helper is a predefined query that is easily available for each table.
By default, all database schemes available in `vim-dadbod` have a `List` table
helper, which is just a simple query to list the data from the table.
Certain schemes (postgesql, mysql, sqlite) have few more helpers, like
`Indexes`, `Forein Keys`, `Primary Keys`, etc.

To define your own helper for a specific scheme, add it through
`g:db_ui_table_helpers` variable like this:

>
 	let g:db_ui_table_helpers = {
	\ 	'postgresql': {
	\ 		'Count': 'select count(*) from {optional_schema}{table}'
	\ 		'Explain': 'EXPLAIN ANALYZE {last_query}'
	\ 	}
 	\ }
<
This will make `Count` table helper available for all postgresql connections
for each table. Five variables are available as part of the table helper
content: `{table}`, `{schema}`, `{optional_schema}`, `{dbname}` and `{last_query}`. You can also override the
defaults by passing in the matching helper name. To override `List`, do this:

>
 	let g:db_ui_table_helpers = {
	\ 	'postgresql': {
	\ 		'List': 'select * from {table} order by id asc'
	\ 	}
 	\ }

Note that `{last_query}` will be empty if no queries were ran before opening
that helper. Also, in the `EXPLAIN` example above, running the explain helper
and then running it again for another table will print double `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`
because first explain query is also considered a valid query for `{last_query}`.

`{optional_schema}`is provided only when the current table schema is not the
default one. If provided, it goes in format `schemaname.`, so if you need to
write select queries, add it like this:
`select * from {optional_schema}{table}`, which will expand into for example:
`select * from information_schema.columns`, or for public schema in postgres,
`select * from mytable`

==============================================================================
7. Bind parameters				*vim-dadbod-ui-bind-parameters*

Bind parameters are variables that can be injected into the query at execution
time. For example, when executing this query
>
	select * from contacts where id = :contactId
<
A prompt will pop up to enter a value for `:contactId`. Once you enter the
value, it will execute the query with that value injected. It will not modify
the content of the buffer, but replace the parameter with value on execution
time. This will happen for every other time that you run the query from this
buffer with that parameter name. Values for parameters are saved in the buffer
variable.
To edit or delete a bind parameter, use |<Plug>(DBUI_EditBindParameters)|
mapping (by default `<Leader>E`). It will open a list of all parameters
defined, where you can selecting and then edit/delete it.
In cases where a certain value from query is read as bind parameter (For
example, your sql contains a string that really needs to check for some value
with a colon prefix), just leave the bind parameter empty, and it will be
considered a raw value (not replaced).
For example, if you have this query:
>
	select * from posts where body LIKE '%:thething%'
<
`:thething` will be considered a bind parameter. Do not define a value, and it
will be ignored.

To pass an empty string, use two single quotes as value. Example:
>
	select * from posts where subject != :subject
<
On prompt, entering `''` will run this query:
>
	select * from posts where subject != ''
<

Certain values are parsed so they are injected as right type:

1. Numbers - If the content of parameter is only a number, it will not be
quoted
2. Booleans - `true` and `false` are not quoted

Every other value is automatically quoted. If you want to force quotes on a
certain value (for example, to check the number as a string), just add quotes
when defining the value and it will be treated as string.

==============================================================================

8. Settings					*vim-dadbod-ui-settings*

		  Example: "New Query", "List", "Indexes"
		* table - table name if buffer was created from table helper,
		  or empty string
		* schema - schema name if buffer was created from table
		  helper, or empty string
		* filetype - filetype that will be used for the buffer
		Note the uppercase `D`, which is required by vim for
		functions.
		Also, `make sure that name is always unique` to avoid any issues
		with overlapping names.
		Example:
>
		function s:buffer_name_generator(opts)
		  if empty(a:opts.table)
		    return 'myquery-'.localtime()
		  endif
		  return 'myquery-fortable-'.a:opts.table.'-'.localtime()

9. Functions					*vim-dadbod-ui-functions*

					      *db_ui#statusline()*
db_ui#statusline({opts})
		Return statusline information. For example, when table `posts`
		is opened from schema named `public` in database named `my-blog-db`,
		result will be this:
>
		DBUI: my_blog -> public -> posts
<
		Function accepts optional dictionary with these properties set
		as default:
>
		{
		  'prefix': 'DBUI: ',
		  'separator': ' -> ',
		  'show': ['db_name', 'schema', 'table']
		}
<
		For example, just to show DB name and table without prefix
		separated by a dash (`my_blog - posts`), you would call statusline like this:
>
		call db_ui#statusline({
		  \ 'show': ['db_name', 'table'],
		  \ 'separator' : ' - ',
		  \ 'prefix': ''
		  \ })
<

					      *db_ui#query()*
db_ui#query({query})
		Execute query and return results as array of arrays.
		Works only for `PostgreSQL`, `MySQL` and `Sqlserver`.
		Requires valid dbui sql buffer, or a `b:db` connection variable.
		There are also 2 more buffer vars available:
		* `b:dbui_table_name` - Name of the table for current buffer
		* `b:dbui_schema_name` - Name of the schema for current buffer

		For example, to generate an `INSERT` query with a mapping for
		current dbui sql buffer, you would have something like this in
		your vimrc:
>
		function! s:populate_query() abort
		  let rows = db_ui#query(printf(
		    \ "select column_name, data_type from information_schema.columns where table_name='%s' and table_schema='%s'",
		    \ b:dbui_table_name,
		    \ b:dbui_schema_name
		    \ ))
		  let lines = ['INSERT INTO '.b:dbui_table_name.' (']
		  for [column, datatype] in rows
		    call add(lines, column)
		  endfor
		  call add(lines, ') VALUES (')
		  for [column, datatype] in rows
		    call add(lines, printf('%s <%s>', column, datatype))
		  endfor
		  call add(lines, ')')
		  call setline(1, lines)
		endfunction

		autocmd FileType sql nnoremap <buffer><leader>i :call <sid>populate_query()
<
					      *db_ui#connections_list()*
db_ui#connections_list()
		Return list of all available connections. These properties are
		returned:

		* name - Connection name
		* source - Where is connection defined (file, g:dbs, env, dotenv)
		* url - Connection url
		* is_connected - Is DBUI connected to this database

==============================================================================
10. Autocommands				*vim-dadbod-ui-autocommands*

					      *DBUIOpened*
DBUIOpened
		This autocommand is triggered when dbui drawer is opened, and
		everything is set up. For example, to load additional
		connections from custom env file using `vim-dotenv`, you could
		do have something like this in your vimrc to load them:

		`autocmd User DBUIOpened let b:dotenv = DotenvRead('.envrc') | norm R`

==============================================================================
11. Highlights					*vim-dadbod-ui-highlights*

To customize the colors of the notifications, add these custom hl groups:
* `NotificationInfo`
* `NotificationWarning`
* `NotificationError`

For example, to use white text on blue(info) / yellow(warning) / red(error) background,
add this to your vimrc/init.vim:
>
    hi NotificationInfo guifg=#FFFFFF guibg=#0000FF
    hi NotificationWarning guifg=#FFFFFF guibg=#FFFF00
    hi NotificationError guifg=#FFFFFF guibg=#FF0000
