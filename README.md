# vim-dadbod-ui

Simple UI for [vim-dadbod](https://github.com/tpope/vim-dadbod).
It allows simple navigation through databases and allows saving queries for later use.

Tested on Linux and Mac, Vim 8+ an Neovim.

Features:
* Navigate through multiple databases and it's tables and schemas
* Several ways to define your connections
* Save queries on single location for later use
* Define custom table helpers
* Bind parameters (see `:help vim-dadbod-ui-bind-parameters`)
* Autocompletion with [vim-dadbod-completion](https://github.com/kristijanhusak/vim-dadbod-completion)
* Jump to foreign keys from the dadbod output (see `:help <Plug>(DBUI_JumpToForeignKey)`)
* Support for nerd fonts (see `:help g:db_ui_use_nerd_fonts`)

## Installation
### With a package manager
Use your favorite package manager. If you don't have one, I suggest [vim-packager](https://github.com/kristijanhusak/vim-packager)
```vimL
function! PackagerInit() abort
  packadd vim-packager
  call packager#init()
  call packager#add('kristijanhusak/vim-packager', { 'type': 'opt' })
  call packager#add('tpope/vim-dadbod')
  call packager#add('kristijanhusak/vim-dadbod-ui')
endfunction

" This is just an example. Keep this out of version control. Check for more examples below.
let g:dbs = {
\  'dev': 'postgres://postgres:mypassword@localhost:5432/my-dev-db'
\ }
```

### Without a package manager
First, ensure vim-dadbod is installed, by following Tim Pope his [instructions](https://github.com/tpope/vim-dadbod#installation)
Then run the following commands to install this plugin:
```
mkdir -p $HOME/.vim/pack/plugins/start
cd $HOME/.vim/pack/plugins/start
git clone https://github.com/kristijanhusak/vim-dadbod-ui.git
```

Optionally, install [vim-dadbod-completion](https://github.com/kristijanhusak/vim-dadbod-completion) as well:
```
mkdir -p $HOME/.vim/pack/plugins/start
cd $HOME/.vim/pack/plugins/start
git clone https://github.com/kristijanhusak/vim-dadbod-completion.git
```

## What to do after installing
After installation, run `:DBUI`, which should open up a drawer with all databases provided.
When you finish writing your query, just write the file (`:w`) and it will automatically execute the query for that database and it will automatically execute the query for selected database.

## Databases
There are 3 ways to provide database connections to UI:

1. [Through environment variables](#through-environment-variables)
2. [Via g:dbs global variable](#via-gdbs-global-variable)
3. [Via :DBUIAddConnection command](#via-dbuiaddconnection-command)

#### Through environment variables
If `$DBUI_URL` env variable exists, it will be added as a connection. Name for the connection will be parsed from the url.
If you want to use a custom name, pass `$DBUI_NAME` alongside the url.
Env variables that will be read can be customized like this:

```vimL
let g:db_ui_env_variable_url = 'DATABASE_URL'
let g:db_ui_env_variable_name = 'DATABASE_NAME'
```

Optionally you can leverage [dotenv.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-dotenv)
to specific any number of connections in an `.env` file by using a specific
prefix (defaults to `DB_UI_`). The latter part of the env variable becomes the
name of the connection (lowercased)

```bash
# .env
DB_UI_DEV=...          # becomes the `dev` connection
DB_UI_PRODUCTION=...   # becomes the `production` connection
```

The prefix can be customized like this:

```vimL
let g:db_ui_dotenv_variable_prefix = 'MYPREFIX_'
```

#### Via g:dbs global variable
Provide list with all databases that you want to use through `g:dbs` variable as an array of objects or an object:

```vimL
let g:dbs = {
\ 'dev': 'postgres://postgres:mypassword@localhost:5432/my-dev-db',
\ 'staging': 'postgres://postgres:mypassword@localhost:5432/my-staging-db',
\ 'wp': 'mysql://root@localhost/wp_awesome',
\ }
```

Or if you want them to be sorted in the order you define them, this way is also available:

```vimL
let g:dbs = [
\ { 'name': 'dev', 'url': 'postgres://postgres:mypassword@localhost:5432/my-dev-db' }
\ { 'name': 'staging', 'url': 'postgres://postgres:mypassword@localhost:5432/my-staging-db' },
\ { 'name': 'wp', 'url': 'mysql://root@localhost/wp_awesome' },
\ ]
```
Just make sure to **NOT COMMIT** these. I suggest using project local vim config (`:help exrc`)

#### Via :DBUIAddConnection command

Using `:DBUIAddConnection` command or pressing `A` in dbui drawer opens up a prompt to enter database url and name,
that will be saved in `g:db_ui_save_location` connections file. These connections are available from everywhere.

#### Connection related notes
It is possible to have two connections with same name, but from different source.
for example, you can have `my-db` in env variable, in `g:dbs` and in saved connections.
To view from which source the database is, press `H` in drawer.
If there are duplicate connection names from same source, warning will be shown and first one added will be preserved.

## Settings
### Table helpers
Table helper is a predefined query that is available for each table in the list.
Currently, default helper that each scheme has for it's tables is `List`, which for most schemes defaults to `g:db_ui_default_query`.
Postgres, Mysql and Sqlite has some additional helpers defined, like "Indexes", "Foreign Keys", "Primary Keys".

Predefined query can inject current db name and table name via `{table}` and `{dbname}`.

To add your own for a specific scheme, provide it through .`g:db_ui_table_helpers`.

For example, to add a "count rows" helper for postgres, you would add this as a config:

```vimL
let g:db_ui_table_helpers = {
\   'postgresql': {
\     'Count': 'select count(*) from "{table}"'
\   }
\ }
```

Or if you want to override any of the defaults, provide the same name as part of config:
```vimL
let g:db_ui_table_helpers = {
\   'postgresql': {
\     'List': 'select * from "{table}" order by id asc'
\   }
\ }
```

### Auto execute query
If this is set to `1`, opening any of the table helpers will also automatically execute the query.

Default value is: `0`

To enable it, add this to vimrc:

```vimL
let g:db_ui_auto_execute_table_helpers = 1
```

### Icons
These are the default icons used:

```vimL
let g:db_ui_icons = {
    \ 'expanded': '▾',
    \ 'collapsed': '▸',
    \ 'saved_query': '*',
    \ 'new_query': '+',
    \ 'tables': '~',
    \ 'buffers': '»',
    \ 'connection_ok': '✓',
    \ 'connection_error': '✕',
    \ }
```

You can override any of these:
```vimL
let g:db_ui_icons = {
    \ 'expanded': '+',
    \ 'collapsed': '-',
    \ }
```

### Help text
To hide `Press ? for help` add this to vimrc:

```
let g:db_ui_show_help = 0
```

Pressing `?` will show/hide help no matter if this option is set or not.

### Drawer width

What should be the drawer width when opened. Default is `40`.

```vimL
let g:db_ui_winwidth = 30
```

### Default query

**DEPRECATED**: Use [Table helpers](#table-helpers) instead.

When opening up a table, buffer will be prepopulated with some basic select, which defaults to:
```sql
select * from table LIMIT 200;
```
To change the default value, use `g:db_ui_default_query`, where `{table}` is placeholder for table name.

```vimL
let g:db_ui_default_query = 'select * from "{table}" limit 10'
```

### Save location
All queries are by default written to tmp folder.
There's a mapping to save them permanently for later to the specific location.

That location is by default `~/.local/share/db_ui`. To change it, addd `g:db_ui_save_location` to your vimrc.
```vimL
let g:db_ui_save_location = '~/Dropbox/db_ui_queries'
```

## Mappings
These are the default mappings for `dbui` drawer:

* o / <CR> - Open/Toggle Drawer options (`<Plug>(DBUI_SelectLine)`)
* S - Open in vertical split (`<Plug>(DBUI_SelectLineVsplit)`)
* d - Delete buffer or saved sql (`<Plug>(DBUI_DeleteLine)`)
* R - Redraw (`<Plug>(DBUI_Redraw)`)
* A - Add connection (`<Plug>(DBUI_AddConnection)`)
* H - Toggle database details (`<Plug>(DBUI_ToggleDetails)`)

For queries, filetype is automatically set to `sql`. Also, two mappings is added for the `sql` filetype:

* <Leader>W - Permanently save query for later use (`<Plug>(DBUI_SaveQuery)`)
* <Leader>E - Edit bind parameters (`<Plug>(DBUI_EditBindParameters)`)

Any of these mappings can be overridden:
```vimL
autocmd FileType dbui nmap <buffer> v <Plug>(DBUI_SelectLineVsplit)
```

If you don't want any mappings to be added, add this to vimrc:
```vimL
let g:db_ui_disable_mappings = 1
```

## TODO

* [ ] Test on Windows
* [ ] Test with more db types
